# Detecting-COVID-19-with-Chest-X-Ray-using-PyTorch

Image classification of Chest X Rays in one of three classes: Normal, Viral Pneumonia, COVID-19  

Guided project Detecting COVID-19 with Chest X Ray using PyTorch on Coursera 

Dataset from COVID-19 Radiography Dataset on Kaggle

## Coursera
In this guided project, we will use a ResNet-18 model and train it on a COVID-19 Radiography dataset. 
This dataset has nearly 3000 Chest X-Ray scans which are categorized in three classes - Normal, Viral Pneumonia and COVID-19. 
Our objective in this project is to create an image classification model that can predict Chest X-Ray scans that belong to one of the three classes with a reasonably high accuracy.

NB : Please note that this dataset, and the model that we train in the project, can not be used to diagnose COVID-19 or Viral Pneumonia. We are only using this data for educational purpose.
